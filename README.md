# WindowsBotnetIpBlocker

### Overview
WindowsBotnetIpBlocker is a tool that automatically blocks inbound and outbound connections to known botnet IPs. It retrieves the latest data from [abuse.ch](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/) and utilizes the Windows Firewall to block these IPs, helping to protect your system from potential threats.

### Requirements
- Windows operating system
- Node.JS 8.0.0 or higher
    - Node.JS enables local execution of JavaScript files.
    - Download the version `Recommended For Most Users` from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Download
- Navigate to the green "<> Code" button and choose "Download ZIP".
- Once downloaded, simple extract the files into a folder.

### Instructions
-  Run `Start.bat` as Administrator.
    - Double-clicking should suffice as the batch file attempts to elevate its own privileges.
-  To view the rules generated by this script, navigate to "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security". Then, select "Inbound Rules" and "Outbound Rules".
-  To delete all rules created by this script, execute `RemoveRulesMadeByThisScript.bat` as Administrator.
    - This step is not needed for updating IPs. The script automatically removes all rules before fetching and adding new ones. Use this primarily for clean-up.

### Adding `Start.bat` to Task Scheduler

To automate the execution of WindowsBotnetIpBlocker on a weekly basis, you can add the `Start.bat` file to the Task Scheduler in Windows. Here's how:

1. Open the Task Scheduler application.
2. Click on "Action" â†’ "Create Basic Task" to start the task creation wizard.
3. Give your task a name and description.
4. Choose the frequency (e.g. weekly). You can leave the start time as is.
5. Select "Start a program" as the action to perform.
6. Browse and select the `Start.bat` file from the WindowsBotnetIpBlocker project directory.
7. Complete the wizard by following the remaining prompts.

Once the task is created, Windows will automatically execute the `Start.bat` file on a weekly basis, ensuring that your system is protected from botnet IPs.
